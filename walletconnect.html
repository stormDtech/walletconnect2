    <h2 class="ariticle-text">Fequently asked questions?</h2>

    <p><strong>What is walletConnect?</strong><br>
      <a href="#here">WalletConnect </a>helps you to use a Dapp with a mobile wallet. it works on both mobile and desktop and is becoming one of the main standard for Dapp access in wallets.</p>

      <p><strong>How can i use it?</strong>
        <li>Open the option to connect to a wallet.</li>
        <li>Select a wallet among the wallet options you will be presented with</li>
        <li> You will be prompted to import your wallet.</li></p>
    <p> <strong> Is WalletConnect safe?</strong><br>
    Mobile application in general are not as secure as hardware wallet. Hardware wallet come with well-defined security and specific security solutions that allows them to more securely store and interact with users.<br>
    However, walletconnect establishes a secure encrypted connection between your wallet and DApp. All informatiom transmitted between the wallet and DApp is encrypted symmetrically with a shared key that only these two parties posses. Whether you scan a QR code or use a deep link with a mobile wallet, the primary key isn't shared with the bridge server-that is, the key isn't linked to any thrid party, including the intermediary carrying out the secured transaction.</p>

    <p><strong>What Dapps are supported?</strong><br>
      You can find the full list of supported Dapps <a href="connect to a wallet.html">here.</a></p>
